## ‚ö†Ô∏èALPHA BUILD <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Chatify 3.0 is in alpha, and will remain so for a while.

## ‚ùì Why 3.0? <a name = "limitations"></a>

There are a total of 3 different Chatify versions and the other 2 were unfortunately discontinued forever.
The reasons:
1.0-Unfortunately I made it super messy so that the code was hard to understand and it wasn't
    programmed with node.js but with php (I can't really do php xD)
2.0-It was also super confusing and had no object orientation and because I took a break from it
    for half a year I no longer understood the code
3.0-I learned from my mistakes and now program the server side in Typscript. I hope that this build
    ends successfully!

## üöÄ The Furture about Chatify 3.0 <a name = "future_scope"></a>

In the future I plan to make Chatify more community based and much more manageable!

## üéà Status <a name="usage"></a>

I don't know yet if I'll update this xD:
  ~15%
